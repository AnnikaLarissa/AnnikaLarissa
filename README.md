📚 My projects
-

Unfortunately, many of the projects I did in university and on my side job as a programmer aren't public. But feel free to check out some of my public projects! I'm sure they will represent my code style just as well.

📖 MIMIC-IV (public)
-

This is a research conducted by me and @alexanderm0 about the application of federated learning on monoethnic clinical data to determine kidney related diagnoses using the MIMIC-IV dataset.
This research is conducted for the course Research Methodology and Scientific Writing at @KTH. 
As the research topic and execution were free of choice, this project represents my way of working very well.

📖 Advent Of Code (public)
-

For every day in December, one programming challenge becomes available on https://adventofcode.com/2022. In this repository I share my code answers for every day I participated in the challenge.

📖 Sentelligent (private)
-

This is my bachelor's thesis for the Royal Netherlands Army. 
Together with 9 other bachelor students we designed the front- and backend for a militaity mission planning system to autonomously control unmanned ground vehicles (UGV).
Due to the secrecy of the military plannings algorithms, Sentelligent has to stay private.
