📚 My projects
-

Unfortunately, many of the projects I did in university and on my side job as a programmer are private due to intellectual property rights :frowning_face:. 
However, you can see the list of project names and the contibutions I made.

📖 MIMIC-IV (public)
-

This is a research conducted by me and @alexanderm0 about the application of federated learning on monoethnic clinical data to determine kidney related diagnoses using the MIMIC-IV dataset.
This research is conducted for the course Research Methodology and Scientific Writing at @KTH. 
As the research topic and execution were free of choice, this project represents my way of working very well.

📖 Sentelligent (private)
-

This is my bachelor's thesis for the Royal Netherlands Army. 
Together with 9 other bachelor students we designed the front- and backend for a militaity mission planning system to autonomously control unmanned ground vehicles (UGV).
Due to the secrecy of the military plannings algorithms, Sentelligent has to stay private.
